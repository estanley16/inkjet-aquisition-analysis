# inkjet_aquisition_analysis

My first coding project, developed for my undergraduate thesis

This goal of this project was to develop an automated program capable of acquiring images of cells contained in inkjet-printed droplets as well as analyze the images to report the number of cells within each droplet. 

The program was developed to assist in training of a deep learning classifier that quantifies cell encapsulation rates from an inkjet printer nozzle in real time.
